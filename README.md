## 📚 Projects

### 1. 🎗️ [Breast Cancer Classification](./Breast%20Cancer%20Classification/)

**Type**: Binary Classification  
**Architecture**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
**Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) (569 samples, 30 features)

**Description**: A deep learning project to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant or Benign based on digitized image features. This project utilizes a Neural Network constructed with TensorFlow/Keras to learn patterns from complex medical data for early disease detection.

**Model Performance**:

- **Test Accuracy**: **~95.6%**
- **Test Loss**: **~0.158**
- High precision in distinguishing between malignant and benign cases.

**Key Concepts Learned**:

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Building models using TensorFlow and Keras Sequential API
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Designing dense layers with ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions
- **Data Standardization**: Using `StandardScaler` to normalize features for better convergence
- **Model Training**: Configuring epochs, batch sizes, and validation splits
- **Evaluation**: Visualizing accuracy/loss curves and using sparse categorical cross-entropy
- **Medical Informatics**: Handling sensitve biomedical data structures
